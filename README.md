An android application for daily activity tracking.

## Purpose, ideas and notes

Purpose of the project is mainly to: 

- to exercise and explore Test Driven Development in Android environment
- improve my skill-set around testing
- explore some libraries, mainly AAC

I decided to start with **minimal dependencies** and **no architecture** and to try to discover a need for architecture and more dependencies during TDD cycles. I am still biased by my ideas about the technologies I want to use, so I may steer my way into them a bit. This is the hard way and not really production-time way. But I believe it's an interesting exercise.

Let's say we will consider only a single activity application. So navigation will be done using fragments.
